# Configure Apple PIM Access

Help the user configure which calendars and reminder lists the apple-pim plugin can access.

## Process

1. **List available calendars and reminder lists** using the MCP tools
2. **Read existing config** from `~/.claude/apple-pim.local.md` if it exists
3. **Ask user which to allow** using AskUserQuestion with multi-select options
4. **Write config file** to `~/.claude/apple-pim.local.md`
5. **Remind user to restart** Claude Code for changes to take effect

## Configuration File Format

Write the config file in this exact format:

```yaml
---
calendars:
  mode: allowlist  # allowlist | blocklist | all
  items:
    - "Calendar Name 1"
    - "Calendar Name 2"
reminders:
  mode: allowlist
  items:
    - "List Name 1"
    - "List Name 2"
contacts:
  mode: all
default_calendar: "Calendar Name"
default_reminder_list: "List Name"
---

# Apple PIM Configuration

This file controls which calendars and reminder lists Claude Code can access.

## Modes

- **allowlist**: Only the listed items are accessible
- **blocklist**: All items EXCEPT the listed ones are accessible
- **all**: All items are accessible (default)

## Defaults

The `default_calendar` and `default_reminder_list` settings specify where new
events and reminders are created when no specific calendar/list is specified.

## Changes

Edit this file to modify access. Restart Claude Code after changes.
```

## Workflow

1. First, call `calendar_list` and `reminder_lists` to get available options
2. Check if `~/.claude/apple-pim.local.md` exists and read current settings
3. Ask the user:
   - Which calendars should be accessible? (multi-select)
   - Which reminder lists should be accessible? (multi-select)
   - Which calendar should be the default for new events?
   - Which list should be the default for new reminders?
4. Write the configuration file
5. Display a summary and remind user to restart Claude Code
