2. **Not selecting airline** - Amex airline credit won't work until you select an airline
3. **Missing enrollment** - Delta Reserve credits require enrollment
4. **Booking direct vs portal** - Some credits only work through specific portals (Chase Travel, Capital One Travel)
5. **Not using December Uber bonus** - Extra $20 for Amex Platinum in December
6. **Ignoring companion certificates** - Can save $200-500 on flights
